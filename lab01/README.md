This is the default ReactNative/Expo application committed and pushed as a 
sub-directory in a CS 262 GitHub repo. This is the model for submitting CS 262 
assignments.

Note that when Expo initializes a new application, it automatically creates a 
`.git` directory in the root of the application (and a `.gitignore` file). 
When you have potentially many applications sharing the same class repo, 
be sure to delete this `.git` sub-directory before you commit and push the application. 
(You can keep the `gitignore` file.) Supporting nested git repos is 
[tricky](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1811730/how-do-i-work-with-a-git-repository-within-another-repository)
and not necessary here.
